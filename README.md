# BinarySearchTree

# This project is a practice of the BST data structure implementation and it's methods.
# 3 Separate Classes to define the Nodes (node.py), defining the methods (BSTMethods.py), and execution (main.py)

# n = number of nodes
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n)

# Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

# - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
# - The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
# - The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

Challenges:
- BST is not a Python implemented base data structure, has to be created manually.
- BST Algorithms require deep understanding of the BTS ta structure.
- Scalability requires extra steps
